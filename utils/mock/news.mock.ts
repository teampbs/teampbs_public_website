    title: 'Making Learning Fun: Teaching Pivotal Skills',

    description: `Jordan is a four-year-old child with autism. He has a limited vocabulary and typically communicates his needs and wants by acting out, aggressively. This behavior has become a barrier and has made it increasingly difficult for him to learn a variety of age-appropriate skills from communication to appropriate social and play skills. Jordan’s parents have placed him in a program designed to target his needs and barriers. After a couple weeks, Jordan began demonstrating noticeable growth in a number of different areas. His vocabulary was steadily growing, his play skills were improving, and his aggressive behavior had begun diminishing in frequency and intensity. He was a completely different child! These pleasant observations led to optimistic curiosity, ultimately bringing Jordan’s parents to request an observation of their child’s treatment session. They were very impressed with these early results and wondered how exactly these professionals were able to achieve this kind of success with their child. To their surprise, for most of the session, the therapist appeared to just play with Jordan and a few other children, moving from one game or activity to the next. After the session, they were still in awe and were eager to understand exactly how the therapist had been able to bring about so much change spending all the time letting their child just ‘play’. Jordan’s therapist, familiar with this reaction, simply smiled and began explaining the “ins and outs” of Pivotal Response Training (PRT). What is Pivotal Response Training (PRT)? Pivotal Response Training (PRT) is an intervention developed by Lynn and Bob Koegel that integrates principles of child development with those of applied behavior analysis (ABA). PRT builds on a child’s motivation and interests, and is particularly effective for developing communication, language, imitation, play skills, joint attention, and and social skills (Vismara & Bogin, 2009). Pivotal skills are foundational in that they set the stage for children to make widespread improvements in many other areas of their lives. Developing these skills will reduce inappropriate behaviors from occurring in the future as children’s frustrations diminish. PRT focuses on improving developmentally appropriate behavior in natural settings. How do we use PRT?
