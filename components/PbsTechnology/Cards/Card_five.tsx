      plans include:

    <h3 css={heading}>Prevention:</h3>
    <p>
      modifying aspects of the environment to avoid problems, make
      difficult circumstances better, or add cues to prompt more adaptive
      behavior.
    </p>
    <h3 css={heading}>Teaching:</h3>
    <p>
      building skills to help the individual communicate his or her needs,
      interact with other people, deal with unpleasant circumstances, or
      become more self-sufficient.
    </p>
    <h3 css={heading}>Management:</h3>
    <p>
      providing consequences that reinforce positive behavior and withhold
      outcomes that may be desirable to individuals when engaging in
      problem behavior.
